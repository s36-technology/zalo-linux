# Zalo Linux Port 2026
⚠️ **Work in Progress** - This project is under active development.
A Linux port of Zalo, bringing the popular Vietnamese messaging application to the Linux platform.

## How It Works

This is an unofficial port of the **Zalo macOS desktop client** to Linux — not a web wrapper. Calls are not supported yet.

The port was created by:
1. Extracting the `.dmg` from the macOS version
2. Locating `app.asar` at `/Applications/Zalo.app/Contents/Resources/`
3. Extracting it with `asar extract app.asar app`
4. Running the extracted app with Electron 22.3.27 (`electron .`)

> Note: Newer versions of Electron cause errors — v22.3.27 is required.

## Installation

Download the latest Linux package from the [Releases](https://github.com/realdtn2/zalo-linux-2026/releases/latest) page.

### AppImage
```bash
chmod +x Zalo-*.AppImage
./Zalo-*.AppImage
```

### Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install ./Zalo-*.deb
```

### Snap
```bash
sudo snap install --dangerous ./Zalo-*.snap
```

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install --ignore-engines
```

Run locally:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Build all Linux packages:

```bash
yarn build
```

Build one package:

```bash
yarn build:appimage
yarn build:deb
yarn build:snap
```

## Usage

**Launch the application**:
- Open Zalo from your application launcher or desktop launcher
## Features

### `zcall` (Audio & Video Calling)

**Status:** ⚠️ Engine unported, Linux IPC mock available

**Description:**  
A massive proprietary VoIP and WebRTC stack built around custom ZRTP-based encryption. Implemented through `zcall_mac.node` and responsible for all voice and video calling functionality.

The Linux build includes a wired `ZaloCall` helper process and IPC bridge. Run it with:

```bash
yarn dev:call
```

This can expose the call UI and validate the renderer/main/native socket contract. The media/signaling engine still needs a Linux implementation before real audio or video calls can be placed.

---

### `db-cross-v4` (Backup Decryption Engine)

**Status:** ✅ Ported

**Description:**  
Replaces the original macOS Mach-O binary. Intercepts backup restoration calls to decompress and decrypt proprietary ZDB4.0 backup containers using AES-256-CBC and LZMA2, enabling full chat history recovery.

**State:**  
Fully reverse-engineered and reimplemented in C++. The Linux replacement is complete and currently active.

---

### `zjxl` (JPEG-XL Codec Support)

**Status:** ❌ Unported

**Description:**  
Responsible for decoding JPEG-XL image files. Depends on a large bundled ecosystem of macOS-specific dynamic libraries, including OpenCV, `highway`, and `brotli`.

---

### `zimage` (Advanced Image Processing)

**Status:** ❌ Unported

**Description:**  
Performs computationally intensive image operations such as thumbnail generation, resizing, and image transformations using the bundled `libvips-cpp` library.

---

### `mp4thumb` (Video Thumbnail Generation)

**Status:** ❌ Unported

**Description:**  
Generates image thumbnails from `.mp4` attachments. Functions as a native macOS wrapper around a statically linked FFmpeg component that extracts preview frames.

---

### `file-utilities` (Fast Directory Sizing)

**Status:** ❌ Unported (Throws Error)

**Description:**  
A Rust-based NAPI-RS module used for high-performance recursive directory size calculations.

---

### `zwalker` (Recursive Directory Scanner)

**Status:** ❌ Unported (Stubbed)

**Description:**  
Traverses the filesystem to locate files, index content, and discover backups.

---

### `file-utils` (Low-Level File System Utilities)

**Status:** ❌ Unported (Returns "not support")

**Description:**  
Provides native wrappers around common filesystem operations such as moving, copying, and manipulating files.

---

### `v8-profiles` (CPU Profiling)

**Status:** ❌ Unported

**Description:**  
A macOS-specific profiling module used to analyze V8 JavaScript engine performance.

---

### `zfile` (Disk Information)

**Status:** ❌ Unported (Stubbed)

**Description:**  
Retrieves disk usage statistics, storage capacity information, and available free space.

---

### `sqlite3` (Local Database Engine)

**Status:** ✅ Supported

**Description:**  
The native database engine used to access local message shard databases (`.db` files).

**State:**  
The original macOS binary has been replaced with a Linux ELF build (`node_sqlite3.node`) bundled within the application. Functionality is fully operational.

---

### `zaloLogger` (IPC Logging)

**Status:** ✅ Supported

**Description:**  
Custom logging infrastructure utilizing an IPC transport layer.

**State:**  
Implemented entirely in cross-platform JavaScript and requires no platform-specific porting work.
